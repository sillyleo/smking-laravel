# Changelog

## v0.2.0

### Added
- `php artisan smking:doctor [--path=/]` — install verification command. Walks 7 checks (provider registered, config published, API key, base URL, middleware in kernel, API reachable, path status) and exits 0 / 1 accordingly.
- `X-Smking-Status` and `X-Smking-Path` response headers on every middleware-handled HTML 200 GET. Status values: `ready`, `pending`, `not_found`, `disabled`. Lets `curl -I` verify the SDK without depending on backend audit completion.
- Dev-environment HTML comment in non-ready responses (`<!-- smking: middleware-ran path=… status=… url=… reason=… -->`) before `</body>`. Off in production unless `SMKING_DEBUG=true`.
- `config('smking.debug')` — `null` (default, auto-detect by environment), `true` / `false` to force.

### Changed
- **`data-smking-injected="1"` is now decoupled from content readiness.** It appears on every middleware-handled response (HTML 200 GET, not in `except`), regardless of whether the smking backend has audited the URL. Previously it only appeared when fragments were actually injected, which broke local-dev install verification on `.test` / `.local` TLDs the backend can't reach.
- `auto_inject=false` no longer skips middleware registration. The middleware still runs but emits `X-Smking-Status: disabled` and leaves the HTML untouched. This keeps the install-verification path working for sites that prefer manual `<x-smking-aeo />` / facade rendering.

### Unchanged (no breaking)
- `ready` paths inject identically to v0.1.1 (JSON-LD, FAQ, summary, SEO meta).
- SEO conflict detection — host-written `<title>` / `og:*` / canonical preserved.
- Fail-open on API errors / timeouts.
- Service provider auto-discovery.
- composer constraint (PHP 8.1+, Laravel 10/11/12).

## v0.1.1

- `SMKING_BASE_URL` is required (no hardcoded default). The package ships with no fallback so it never silently talks to the wrong host.
- `AeoClient` short-circuits to `notFound()` when base URL is unset and logs a warning.

## v0.1.0

- Initial release: middleware auto-inject, `<x-smking-aeo />` Blade component, `Smking::forPath()` facade.
